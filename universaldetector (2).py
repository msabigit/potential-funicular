    The ``UniversalDetector`` class underlies the ``chardet.detect`` function
    and coordinates all of the different charset probers.

    To get a ``dict`` containing an encoding and its confidence, you can simply
    run:

    .. code::

            u = UniversalDetector()
            u.feed(some_bytes)
            u.close()
            detected = u.result

        Takes a chunk of a document and feeds it through all of the relevant
        charset probers.

        After calling ``feed``, you can check the value of the ``done``
        attribute to see if you need to continue feeding the
        ``UniversalDetector`` more data, or if it has made a prediction
        (in the ``result`` attribute).

        .. note::
           You should always call ``close`` when you're done feeding in your
           document if ``done`` is not already ``True``.
